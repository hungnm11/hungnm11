### Demo Description

Overview

This demo showcases an e-commerce application with a price table, a functional ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù feature, and an interactive quiz section for Node.js questions. This is an initial prototype focusing on essential e-commerce functionalities without requiring user authentication. It serves as a foundation for a more comprehensive application with advanced features to be added in future updates.

Current Features

	1. Price Table:
	 ‚Ä¢ A comprehensive table displaying various products with detailed information including paper size, price, quantity, and business day.
	 ‚Ä¢ Styled table cells for a clean and user-friendly interface.
	2. Add to Cart:
	 ‚Ä¢ Users can add items to the cart directly from the price table and the need for authentication.
	 ‚Ä¢ Real-time updates of cart contents displayed with a badge indicating the number of items in the cart.
	 ‚Ä¢ Dynamic handling of item quantities with an interactive number input field.
	 ‚Ä¢ Ability to remove items from the cart seamlessly, with the cart updating instantly to reflect changes.
	3. Node.js Quiz:
	 ‚Ä¢ An engaging quiz section designed to test users‚Äô knowledge of Node.js.
	 ‚Ä¢ A variety of questions to challenge users and help them learn more about Node.js fundamentals and advanced topics.

Features Done

 	27/08/2024
	1. Apply Authentication:
	 ‚Ä¢ Implement user authentication to secure the cart and checkout processes.
	 ‚Ä¢ Provide personalized user experiences with account-specific cart data.

	09/08/2024
	2. Update Cart:
	 ‚Ä¢ Enable users to update item quantities directly within the cart.
	 ‚Ä¢ Automatically calculate and display the total price based on updated quantities.

Features To-Do (Planned Enhancements)

	3. Checkout Cart:
	 ‚Ä¢ Integrate a secure and user-friendly checkout process.
	 ‚Ä¢ Support for various payment methods to facilitate seamless transactions.
	4. Apply State Management:
	 ‚Ä¢ Integrate Redux Saga, Redux Toolkit and RTK Query.
	5. More Features:
	 ‚Ä¢ Wishlist functionality to allow users to save items for later.
	 ‚Ä¢ Order history tracking for users to view past purchases.
	 ‚Ä¢ Enhanced UI/UX improvements for a more intuitive and enjoyable shopping experience.

Features Improvement (Planned Enhancements but cannot apply these by limitation from Vercel Server)

	2. Real-Time ‚ÄúUpdate Cart‚Äù Using WebSocket and Socket.IO: The ‚ÄúUpdate Cart‚Äù feature will be enhanced to support real-time updates of the total price using WebSocket technology, specifically with the integration of Socket.IO. This improvement will allow for a seamless and instantaneous update of the cart‚Äôs total price across all connected clients as soon as any changes occur in the cart‚Äôs contents, such as item quantity adjustments.
	


Key Enhancements:

	1. Real-Time Price Synchronization:
	 ‚Ä¢ The total price of the cart will now be updated in real-time whenever a user modifies the quantity of any item in the cart. This ensures that all users connected to the same session or cart will see the updated total price instantly without needing to refresh the page.
	2. Persistent WebSocket Connection:
	 ‚Ä¢ A persistent WebSocket connection will be established between the client and server, enabling continuous two-way communication. This connection will be maintained using Socket.IO, which provides reliable event-based communication over WebSocket.
	3. Immediate Feedback and Error Handling:
	 ‚Ä¢ Users will receive immediate feedback when they update item quantities, including any errors that might occur, such as attempting to set a quantity lower than allowed. This real-time interaction improves the user experience by ensuring that all changes are reflected instantly and accurately.
	4. Scalability and Efficiency:
	 ‚Ä¢ The WebSocket-based approach is designed to be scalable, allowing multiple users to interact with the cart simultaneously while ensuring that all views of the cart remain consistent and up-to-date. This method also reduces the need for frequent server polling, enhancing overall performance.
	5. Automatic Recalculation and Database Synchronization:
	 ‚Ä¢ Whenever an item is added, removed, or its quantity is changed, the server will automatically recalculate the cart‚Äôs total price and update the value in the MongoDB database. This ensures that the stored data always reflects the current state of the cart.

Implementation Overview:

	‚Ä¢ Server-Side: The server will listen for cart update events (e.g., item quantity changes) via WebSocket. Upon receiving an update, the server will recalculate the total price, update the cart in the database, and broadcast the updated cart data to all connected clients.
	‚Ä¢ Client-Side: Clients will establish a WebSocket connection upon loading the cart. Any changes made to the cart by any user will trigger a real-time update, ensuring that all users have a synchronized view of the cart, including the updated total price.

Features To-Do (Planned Enhancements)

	5. More Features:
	 ‚Ä¢ Wishlist functionality to allow users to save items for later.
	 ‚Ä¢ Order history tracking for users to view past purchases.
	 ‚Ä¢ Enhanced UI/UX improvements for a more intuitive and enjoyable shopping experience.

Test Payments with Stripe Test Card

	Use the following Stripe test card details for testing payments:

	‚Ä¢ Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
	‚Ä¢ Expiry: Any valid future date
	‚Ä¢ CVC: Any 3 digits

 	Card number			Scenario								How to test
	4242 4242 4242 4242		The card payment succeeds and doesn‚Äôt require authentication.		Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code.
	4000 0025 0000 3155		The card payment requires authentication.				Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code.
	4000 0000 0000 9995		The card is declined with a decline code like insufficient_funds.	Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code.
	6205 5000 0000 0000 004		The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits.		Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code.

	This will simulate a successful payment when you submit the form.

Features Improvement (Planned Enhancements but cannot apply these by limitation from Vercel Server)

	2. Real-Time ‚ÄúUpdate Cart‚Äù Using WebSocket and Socket.IO: The ‚ÄúUpdate Cart‚Äù feature will be enhanced to support real-time updates of the total price using WebSocket technology, specifically with the integration of Socket.IO. This improvement will allow for a seamless and instantaneous update of the cart‚Äôs total price across all connected clients as soon as any changes occur in the cart‚Äôs contents, such as item quantity adjustments.
	


Key Enhancements:

	1. Real-Time Price Synchronization:
	 ‚Ä¢ The total price of the cart will now be updated in real-time whenever a user modifies the quantity of any item in the cart. This ensures that all users connected to the same session or cart will see the updated total price instantly without needing to refresh the page.
	2. Persistent WebSocket Connection:
	 ‚Ä¢ A persistent WebSocket connection will be established between the client and server, enabling continuous two-way communication. This connection will be maintained using Socket.IO, which provides reliable event-based communication over WebSocket.
	3. Immediate Feedback and Error Handling:
	 ‚Ä¢ Users will receive immediate feedback when they update item quantities, including any errors that might occur, such as attempting to set a quantity lower than allowed. This real-time interaction improves the user experience by ensuring that all changes are reflected instantly and accurately.
	4. Scalability and Efficiency:
	 ‚Ä¢ The WebSocket-based approach is designed to be scalable, allowing multiple users to interact with the cart simultaneously while ensuring that all views of the cart remain consistent and up-to-date. This method also reduces the need for frequent server polling, enhancing overall performance.
	5. Automatic Recalculation and Database Synchronization:
	 ‚Ä¢ Whenever an item is added, removed, or its quantity is changed, the server will automatically recalculate the cart‚Äôs total price and update the value in the MongoDB database. This ensures that the stored data always reflects the current state of the cart.

Implementation Overview:

	‚Ä¢ Server-Side: The server will listen for cart update events (e.g., item quantity changes) via WebSocket. Upon receiving an update, the server will recalculate the total price, update the cart in the database, and broadcast the updated cart data to all connected clients.
	‚Ä¢ Client-Side: Clients will establish a WebSocket connection upon loading the cart. Any changes made to the cart by any user will trigger a real-time update, ensuring that all users have a synchronized view of the cart, including the updated total price.
